I'm a 2nd-year research master student in the program Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht University. Currently, I'm working on a thesis project at Statistics Netherlands focused on automatic transport mode detection in a representative smart survey.

Whenever I'm not behind my laptop, you are likely to find me in a dance studio or off somewhere in a fictional world.

Not interested in statistics, dance, or fiction? Feel free to check out [this paper](https://nsp.lse.ac.uk/articles/109) on the attempted closure of windows in Amsterdam's Red Light District written by Harriet Smith, Valerie Heere, Kevin Peeters, Ivy Drysdale, and me.
