    "text": "I’m a 2nd-year research master student in the program Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at Utrecht University. Currently, I’m working on a thesis project at Statistics Netherlands focused on automatic transport mode detection in a representative smart survey.\nWhenever I’m not behind my laptop, you are likely to find me in a dance studio or off somewhere in a fictional world.\nNot interested in statistics, dance, or fiction? Feel free to check out this paper on the attempted closure of windows in Amsterdam’s Red Light District written by Harriet Smith, Valerie Heere, Kevin Peeters, Ivy Drysdale, and me."
